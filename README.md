# Supervised_machine_learning_house_price_prediction

1.  Visualized and cleaned the data, selected features, imputing missing values and encoded the features.
2.  Selected, built, and optimized multiple models (Linear Regression,XGboost, Decision Tree, Randomforests, KNN) for house prediction. Compared their performance with R score. 
3. The model trained with XGboost got the highst performance score ( R2 = 0.92)
4. Built end to end pipeline for the model,  stored the modelling pipeline with pickle and created a simple web-app with streamlit.
