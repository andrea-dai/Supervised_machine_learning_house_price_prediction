# Supervised_machine_learning_house_price_prediction

1.  Analyzed, cleaned and visualized the data, selected features, imputing missing values and encoded the features.
2.  Selected, built and optimized multiple models (Linear Regression,XGboost, Decision Tree, Randomforests and KNN) for house prices prediction. Compared their performance with R2 score. 
3. The model trained with XGboost got the highst performance score ( R2 = 0.92)
4. Built end to end pipeline for the the final model, stored the modelling pipeline with pickle and created a simple web-app with streamlit. (https://github.com/andrea-dai/Test_deploy_models_to_app)
